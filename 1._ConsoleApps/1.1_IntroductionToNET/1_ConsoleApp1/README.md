# ConsoleApp1

# Objective
Reproduce our previous activities about designing code.
</br>

# Description
This was my first bootcamp project. It's a record of various logic exercises we have done previously about code design.
</br>
On Execute, it will display a console with a menu. Every option is an exercise:

### 1. **Texto - *Text***</br>
Read and write console inputs. Parse data to our desire and return it.

### 2. **Division Entera - *Integer Division***</br>
It will read console inputs and parse them to integers. Then, it will do the operation looping manually, parse again, and return the result.
### 3. **Media - *Avarage***</br>
It asks how many numbers are going to be introduced. Then, the user will be asked for the numbers to do a mean of them; they will be stored in an array. Finally, it will do the average of that array.
### 4. **Comparar Fechas - *Compare Dates***</br>
